"""Integration tests for langextract ADR constraint extraction with LLM-as-judge.

These tests call real LLM APIs and are marked @pytest.mark.integration.
Run with: pytest -m integration
Skip with: pytest -m "not integration"

Requires environment variable for API key (OPENROUTER_API_KEY by default).
Tests auto-skip if the key is not set.

Judge evaluation:
    1. Extract constraints from ADR text using the configured LLM
    2. Present extracted constraints + original ADR text to a judge LLM
    3. Judge scores each extraction on correctness of subject, predicate, object
    4. Assert overall extraction quality meets a minimum threshold

JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
You are evaluating the quality of ADR constraint extractions.

Given an original ADR document and a list of extracted constraints, score each
constraint on three dimensions:

1. **Subject correctness**: Is the subject FQN correct and appropriately scoped?
2. **Predicate correctness**: Is the predicate correct for this constraint?
   - prohibits_dependency: the subject must NOT import or call the object
   - requires_dependency: the subject MUST import or call the object
   - prohibits_implementation: the subject must NOT define the logic described by the object
   - requires_implementation: the subject MUST define the logic described by the object
   - Dependency = subject's imports/calls are constrained
   - Implementation = subject's internal code (what it defines) is constrained
3. **Object correctness**: Is the object FQN correct and appropriately scoped?

Specificity pairs — exclusion pattern:
When an ADR says "no module outside X shall do Y", the correct extraction is TWO constraints:
  - app.*   <prohibits_*>  <object>   (general prohibition)
  - X.*     <requires_*>   <object>   (explicit permission for X)
If you see this pair, treat both constraints as correct. Do NOT penalise app.* for including X.*
— the pair resolves by specificity at evaluation time. A single constraint using a set-difference
subject like "app.* except app.database.*" is wrong; the two-constraint pattern is the correct form.

For each extracted constraint, you must perform a step-by-step analysis BEFORE scoring.
In your `analysis` field, explicitly justify:
- Why the Subject FQN matches or fails the expected scope.
- Whether this constraint is part of a specificity pair, and if so, whether its counterpart is present.
- Why the Predicate matches or fails the architectural intent.
- Why the Object FQN matches or fails the expected scope.
